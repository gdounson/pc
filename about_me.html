  <body><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To tell you a
      little bit about me.&nbsp; I've been in computers and the IT field for a
      very long time and I am very familiar with the hardware components, with
      Windows, and with Linux.<br>
      <br>
      I've seen many different types of PC's and laptops and I'm familiar with
      how they work and how to upgrade them for better performance.<br>
      <br>
      I'm not going to say I know everything about computers, but I do know a
      lot.&nbsp; So I thought I would post this ad on CL to offer any help you
      might need with your computer for either school, work, or personal needs.<br>
      <br>
      But, let's say it's late and your computer crashes; then contact me and
      I'll see how I can help.&nbsp; I also have some parts on hand that may (or
      not) be useful to you in a pinch, like memory, hard drives, NICs, etc.<br>
      <br>
      I'm up late most nights anyway, so I might as well be helpful to somebody
      :), and with some luck, I can help you with your PC woes.</span><br>
